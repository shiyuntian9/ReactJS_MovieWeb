Movie Info ReactJS Single Page Application (SPA)
Welcome to my Movie Info ReactJS Single Page Application (SPA), a dynamic and accessible platform that provides comprehensive information about your favorite films. This application is designed to be your go-to source for everything related to movies, from details about the latest releases to classic cinematic gems.

Features
Multiple Pages: The app boasts multiple "pages" that seamlessly replace the main content, allowing you to dive into different aspects of the movie world.

Responsive Design: Our app's responsive design ensures readability and clarity at any viewport size between adaptive breakpoints (ranging from 360px to 1200px), so you can access movie information on any device.

Dropdown Navigation Menu: Enjoy a dropdown navigation menu that activates either on click or hover/focus, providing ease of access to various movie categories and information.

Accessibility: We prioritize accessibility with semantic HTML, landmark elements, proper heading usage, accurate alt attributes for movie images, and much more. We strive to make the app inclusive to all movie enthusiasts.

Theme Selection: Choose between a light or dark theme that sets the stage for your movie exploration. Your chosen theme applies consistently across all "pages" in the SPA.

Accordion and Tabs: Organize movie details efficiently with accordions or tabs, ensuring users can access information about plot summaries, cast, and more with ease.

Cards and Panels: Engage with visually appealing cards or panels that combine movie images and text, enhancing the presentation of your favorite films.

Image Carousel: Enjoy a dynamic image carousel, showcasing movie posters one at a time for an interactive and visually pleasing experience.
